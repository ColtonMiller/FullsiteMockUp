		<p class="AboutMe">As a kid I always found myself wanting to build and create. It started with music, I learned to play and read music at the age of 8 and now can play over nine instruments of various forms. From there I went to high school and found a new passion carpentry. I quickly was made foreman of the theater's set department and in my Shopomore year, was the youngest Master Builder in the history of the school. Not long after I have found myself captivated and genuinely ecstatic about software development as it allows me to create through the keyboard.</p>
